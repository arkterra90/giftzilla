    <h5>How Does GIFTZILLA Work?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Someone in your group creates a registry and becomes your group admin.</li>
        <li>Your group admin can then share your group's PIN with future group members to join the registry.</li>
        <li>New group members should create a GIFTZILLA account and join their registry.</li>
        <li>Once everyone has joined and completed their wish lists, the admin will be able to send a randomized and anonymous wish list to each member of the group.</li>
        <li>If you're a group member, you'll receive an email with the wish list of another member for you to purchase them gifts.</li>
        <li>Make sure to pay special attention to any notes your admin makes, so you have the details of when the gift exchange will happen.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
